This repository contains a simple example of a Python program that demonstrates a common error in recursive functions: forgetting to handle the base case properly. The program calculates the factorial of a number using recursion. If the input number is 0, the function returns 1, otherwise, it recursively calls itself with the input number minus 1. The program works fine when the input number is non-negative, but it causes a RecursionError when the input number is negative.
